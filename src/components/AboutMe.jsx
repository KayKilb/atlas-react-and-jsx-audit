                Hi, I'm Kaylene Kilbourn. I'm specializing in Full Stack Web Development and currently in my 5th and final trimester. I love working with React, Python, and HTML. After school, I plan to work in an industry that fulfills both my creative and logical sides. Outside of work and school, I enjoy reading, photography, and Pok√©mon GO.
